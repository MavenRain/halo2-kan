# LookupRangeCheck Gadget: Formal Verification Explainer (Kan Edition)

## What is LookupRangeCheck?

The LookupRangeCheck gadget is one of five core circuit components in
Zcash's Orchard shielded protocol.  Its job is deceptively simple:
given a field element `v` and a target bit-width `n`, prove that
`0 <= v < 2^n`.  Range checks appear everywhere in Orchard: ensuring
note values fit in 64 bits, constraining Sinsemilla message chunks to
10 bits, and bounding Merkle tree layer indices.

A bug here would be catastrophic.  If an adversary can bypass a range
check, they could forge note values (creating money from nothing) or
break Merkle path verification (spending notes they do not own).

## How the gadget works

### Full range check (running sum)

To check `v < 2^{K*w}` where `K = 10` (the Sinsemilla constant), the
gadget decomposes `v` into `w` "words" of `K` bits each using a
running sum:

```
z_0 = v
z_{i+1} = (z_i - a_i) / 2^K      for i = 0, ..., w-1
z_w = 0                             (strict mode)
```

Each word `a_i = z_i - 2^K * z_{i+1}` is constrained to lie in
`{0, 1, ..., 2^K - 1}` via a lookup table.  This forces:

```
v = a_0 + 2^K * a_1 + 2^{2K} * a_2 + ... + 2^{(w-1)K} * a_{w-1}
```

with each `a_i < 2^K`, so `v < 2^{K*w}`.

### Short range check (sub-word)

For `s < K` bits (e.g., checking a 3-bit value), the gadget uses a
shift-and-lookup trick:

1. Look up `e` in the table (proves `e < 2^K`)
2. Look up `e * 2^{K-s}` in the table (proves `e * 2^{K-s} < 2^K`)

From (2): `e < 2^K / 2^{K-s} = 2^s`.  The first lookup prevents a
modular wrap-around attack: without it, a large field element could
have its shifted value land back in `[0, 2^K)` after wrapping mod `p`.

## What we prove

### Soundness

"If the circuit accepts, the claimed range bound holds."

- **Running sum** (`soundness_runsum`): If a strict decomposition into
  `w` base-`b` words exists (all lookups pass, `z_w = 0`), then
  `v < b^w`.

- **Short check** (`soundness_short`): If both lookups pass, then
  `e < 2^s`.

### Completeness

"Every valid witness can satisfy the circuit constraints."

- **Running sum** (`completeness_runsum`): For any `v < b^w`, the
  standard base-`b` representation provides a valid witness.

- **Short check** (`completeness_short`): For any `e < 2^s` with
  `s <= K`, both lookup constraints hold.

### No-wrap guarantee

`halo2_short_no_wrap` proves that for the Pallas field (characteristic
`p ~ 2^254`), the multiplication `e * 2^{K-s}` never overflows mod `p`,
ensuring the natural-number reasoning applies to actual field elements.

## Why Kan-only tactics?

The original [halo2-formal](https://github.com/MavenRain/halo2-formal)
proves the same theorems using Mathlib tactics (`omega`, `linarith`,
`ring`, `positivity`, etc.).  This variant restricts all tactic-mode
proofs to the `kan_*` family from
[kan-tactics](https://github.com/MavenRain/kan-tactics), demonstrating
that Kan extensions are sufficient for real-world formal verification,
not just pedagogical examples.

The key adaptation: arithmetic reasoning that Mathlib automates is
carried out explicitly in term mode and routed through `kan_exact`.
Structural proof steps (induction, case analysis, rewriting,
introduction) map directly to their Kan extension counterparts.

## Proof strategy

The proofs are elementary number theory, appropriate for a gadget whose
correctness reduces to basic facts about positional number systems.

1. We define `evalDigits` (base-`b` evaluation) and `baseDecomp`
   (standard base-`b` decomposition) as recursive functions.

2. Soundness follows from the observation that a sum of `w` terms, each
   less than `b`, weighted by powers of `b`, is less than `b^w`.  The
   key inequality chain:
   `d + b*e < b + b*e = b*(e+1) <= b*b^n = b^(n+1)`.

3. Completeness is constructive: the witness is the standard `mod`/`div`
   decomposition, and correctness follows from `v = (v % b) + b * (v / b)`.

4. The short range check reduces to cancelling a positive factor from
   both sides of an inequality, after rewriting `2^K = 2^s * 2^{K-s}`.

## Connection to the grant

This formalization targets the simplest of the five Halo 2 gadgets named
in the Zcash Community Grants proposal (issue #244):

1. Sinsemilla hash
2. Poseidon/Pow5 chip
3. ECC gadget
4. MerklePath gadget
5. **LookupRangeCheck** (this file)

LookupRangeCheck is the natural starting point because it has no
dependencies on the other gadgets, uses no curve arithmetic or hash
internals, and provides foundational range-checking infrastructure that
the other gadgets rely on.
